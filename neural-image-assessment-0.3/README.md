# NIMA: Neural Image Assessment
Implementation of [NIMA: Neural Image Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05424) in Keras + Tensorflow with weights for MobileNet model trained on AVA dataset.

NIMA assigns a Mean + Standard Deviation score to images, and can be used as a tool to automatically inspect quality of images or as a loss function to further improve the quality of generated images.
